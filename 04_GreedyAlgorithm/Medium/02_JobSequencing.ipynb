    "### **Understanding the Problem Correctly**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key rules:\n",
    "- Each job requires **one unit of time** to complete.\n",
    "- Only **one job** can be scheduled at any given time slot.\n",
    "- Every job has a specific **deadline** (the latest time slot it can be scheduled) and a **profit**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**  \n",
    "Select jobs to maximize the **total profit**, ensuring each job is completed before its deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "A job’s deadline indicates the last possible time slot for its completion. For example, a job with a deadline of 5 can be scheduled in any slot from 1 to 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Illustration:**  \n",
    "Suppose you have three jobs, each with a deadline of 5. Since there are five available slots, all three jobs can be scheduled.  \n",
    "If you have six jobs with a deadline of 5, only five can be scheduled—so you should choose the five jobs with the highest profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- Job 1: Deadline = 2, Profit = 100  \n",
    "- Job 2: Deadline = 1, Profit = 90  \n",
    "Ans: Both jobs can be scheduled = **190**."
